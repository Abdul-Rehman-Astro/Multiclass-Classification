# Multiclass-Classification-Into
Welcome to this Mulitcalss Classifiaction explained notebook! I will be using the Sign Language MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the english alphabet.

You will need to pre-process the data so that it can be fed into your convolutional neural network to correctly classify each image as the letter it represents.

# Initailly Accuracy at 74%

By tweaking our model's architecture we have achieved better accuracy

# Finally Accuracy at 85%

Try tweaking your model's architecture or the augmentation techniques to see if you can achieve more levels of accuracy.

Let's get started!
